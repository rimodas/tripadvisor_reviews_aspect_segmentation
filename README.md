# tripadvisor_reviews_aspect_segmentation
To a business, customer reviews can contain heaps of data that help to identify and correct past concerns, and thus retaining customers which otherwise would be lost. Though reviews range in thoroughness and comprehensibility, they do hold a powerful effect on the behavior of consumersâ€”and therefore, the performance of the business. However, going through hundreds and thousands of reviews for a business is banal and absurd. Alternatively, natural language processing can be leveraged to analyze reviews, interpret pertinent information for applicable departments to act on. A model can be trained on historical reviews of the business and bring forth the major aspects mentioned in them. Thereafter, several business insights can be derived from the model which can be used to address issues and deliver good services. Moreover, as new reviews are generated, they can be automatically processed by the model and tagged with the relevant aspects. This enables the business to have a clearer understanding of what the customers expect from it.
In this project, we demonstrate how to analyze the aspects of a dataset of reviews scraped from TripAdvisor. We used a technique called Aspect Segmentation Algorithm to identify the aspects of each hotel, such as value, rooms, location, cleanliness, check-in/front desk service, business service, in each review.
